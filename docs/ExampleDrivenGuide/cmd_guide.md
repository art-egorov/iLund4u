# Example-driven guide

Here we show usage examples of iund4u command-line interface. Through this guide we will show step-by-step how you can optimise your visualisation starting from default parameters.
 
**Before start:** The necessary sample data as well as adjustable tool configuration files are provided by lovis4u at the post-install step:    
`ilund4u --data` which copies *lovis4u_data* folder to your working directory. 
  
**If you work on a Linux machine** after installation you should run: `ilund4u --linux`  
This command replaces the tools paths (MMseqs2) in the pre-made config files from the MacOS version (default) to the Linux.  
If you run it for fun and want to change it back you can use `ilund4u --mac`.
